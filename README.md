this project is for a school assignemnt. (specifically for the DDOOCP module of L4DC)
Nothing fancy will be in the project as the assignment prompts a simple window form program using C#.
Nothing fancy does not mean it will be easy for me. C# is not a comfort pick of mine and I'm not yet familiar with OOP.
I honestly have no idea how to write a professional-looking README. 
I will work on that for sure, but I'll just write a daily log of the development process and the problems I encounter throughout the project.
